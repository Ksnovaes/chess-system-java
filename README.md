# My First project in Java - Chess System

I am excited to present my first project in the world of Java programming - a chess system that serves as an exercise to enhance my skills. This project has been a stimulating journey, blending logic, creativity, and a touch of elegance in recreating the timeless game of chess.
###### Additionally, I am learning how to format markdown texts as part of the process.

###### I would like to express my gratitude to [NÃ©lio Alves](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/#instructor-1) for his invaluable help throughout this Java trail. Thanks to his guidance, I have gained a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, exception handling, inheritance and polymorphism, enums, arrays, lists, and data structures.
